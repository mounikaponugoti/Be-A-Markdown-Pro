# Be-A-Pro-ReadMe
In this repoistory, we will learn how to write and/or format different things as required to increase the readability of the file.

# Heading 1
This is the largest heading. To make text as heading, add '#' infront of it. In this file to create 'Heading 1', I have used '# Heading 1'

## Heading 2
This is the second largest heading. To create 'Heading 2', I have used '## Heading 1'. Similarly, by adding additional '#'s, size of the heading can be reduced as shown below.
### This is heading 3
###### This is the smallest possible heading

## Line breaks:
Below are the multiple ways to include line breaks. You can choose whichever the one works better for you. <br/>

- By using `<br/>`:
```
After this start a new line.<br/>This is a new line.
```
After this start a new line.<br/>This is a new line.

- By inserting double space:
```
After this start a new line.  (<--two spaces inserted here)This is a new line.
```
After this start a new line.  
This is a new line.

## Styling the text
To stress the imporatance of a sentence or a word, we generally format it as either bold or underline or italic.  
To bold the text, either use `__Text to bold goes here__ , where __ is double underscore` or `**Text to bold goes here** `  
Examples: __Bold this text__, **Bold this text too**  

To change the font to italic, either use `_Text to italicize goes here_` or `*Text to italicize goes here*`  
Examples: *Italicize the text*, _Italicize the text_  

To strikethrough the text, use `~~Text to strikesthrough goes here~~`.  
Examples: ~~This was wrong~~
